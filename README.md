I am N.L.T.Nethsara Liyanage and I am a hardworking and ambitious undergraduate, ready to learn from even the smallest experience I gain. While my passion lies in Computer Software and Hardware, Automobile, Photography and videography, I am determined to successfully face challenges that come in my way any day.

In developing I like to work with React JS, Node JS, JAVA, SQL and NoSQL databases as well as the Android platform.
